The project will track the inventory of the company's materials stored in Excel.

This inventory tracking application will connect to a server and actively provide synchronized real-time stock information to the relevant personnel's computers.

The project consists of two parts: firstly, transferring data correctly from the Excel, which acts as the database in the first part of the project.

In the second part of the project, the goal is to present the data we have obtained in a more readable and functional interface, enhancing visual appeal and allowing for easy addition, deletion, and updating without requiring extra steps.
